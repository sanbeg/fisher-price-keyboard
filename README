Utilities to play with the Fisher Price Fun2Learn keyboard on linux.  Can be
used for web chat, etc. so your toddler won't mess things up too much when
mashing random keys.

fpkbd-echo: Convert key presses into text, write to stdout; supports all
	    keys/buttons.

fpkbd-input: Convert key events into linux uinput events. Run 'insmod
	     uinput' first, then use this (sort of) like a regular keyboard.
	     Implements the alphanumeric keys.

fpkbd-ev: Filters events, and prints the interesting ones; used for
	  debugging/.

85-fpcskbd.rules: udev rules file, to start fpkbd-input when the keyboard is
		  plugged in.
